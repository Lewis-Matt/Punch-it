<h1> Punch-it </h1>
<hr>
<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
Punch-it is a personal project and is a work-in-progress while I am attending a 5-month Java bootcamp. Initially it is web-based (as the bootcamp progress from JS > Java > MySQL), but ideally it would be a mobile application.

<h2>Description</h2>
In the construction industry, the punch-list is a list of all items of work that do not conform to contract specifications, usually attached to the certificate of substantial completion (the contractor must correct the punch list work before receiving payment). However, punch-lists are used in many industries and Punch-it is designed to serve a broad user-base.

<h2>Planned Features</h2> 
- Currently web-based, upgrade to mobile using React Native with Java backend
- Responsive - most-likely used in-field on mobile/tablet
- Project-based directories that can be navigated via tabs
- Within each directory you will be able to:
    - Add photos
    - Add notes
    - Add audio
    - Add video
    - Create a PDF report
    - Push report to database
    - Delete from database
    - Email report
- Create email/distribution list
- Add/Delete projects from database
- Add punch-lists to existing projects (i.e. lists for different project phases)
